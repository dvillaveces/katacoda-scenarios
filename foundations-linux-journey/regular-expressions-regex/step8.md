Now that you've done your editing it's time to actually save and quit out of vim: 

* `:w` - writes or saves the file
* `:q` - quit out of vim
* `:wq` - write and then quit
* `:q!` - quit out of vim without saving the file
* `ZZ` - equivalent of :wq, but one character faster
* `u` - undo your last action
* `Ctrl-r` - redo your last action

You may not think `ZZ` is necessary, but you'll eventually see that your fingers may tend to lean towards this rather than `:wq`.
