In a lot (if not all) of Emacs documentation, you will see the syntax `C-[letter]`. This just means hit the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key and the letter indicated, but for shorthand purposes, we'll write "CTRL" more succinctly, with just `C`. If you see syntax such as `M-[letter]`, that means use the "Meta" key on your keyboard, which is most commonly the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.

# Saving files

* <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> - Save a file
* <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> - Save file as
* <kbd>C-x s</kbd> - Save all

The save file options will prompt you if you want to save each file.

# Opening a file

<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>

This will prompt you to type a filename to open. If you do not have a file that already exists, it will create a new file. You can load up a directory as well.

# Exercise

Play around with opening files and saving files.
