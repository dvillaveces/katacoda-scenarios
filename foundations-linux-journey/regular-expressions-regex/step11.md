To move around buffers (or files you're visiting) use the following commands:

# Switch buffers

* C-x b - switch buffer
* C-x right arrow - right-cycle through buffer
* C-x left arrow - left-cycle through buffer

# Close the buffer

<pre>C-x k</pre>

# Split the current buffer

<pre>C-x 2</pre>

This allows you see multiple buffers on one screen. To move between these buffers use: <kbd>C-x o</kbd>

# Set a single buffer as the current screen

<kbd>C-x 1</kbd>

If you ever used a terminal multiplexer like `screen` or `tmux`, Emacs's buffer commands will feel very familiar.

# Exercise

Play around with buffers.
