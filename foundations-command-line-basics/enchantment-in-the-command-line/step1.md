First, gather.

If you are alone, gather yourself. If you are with others, gather together in a circle.

Brew up a big pot of chamomile tea (since computers often makes people stressed in general, so chamomile is nice always).

Using a projector, monitor, or large painting, display a series calming image, animated if you like, somewhere in view. For example, I projected [a series of pixel art flowers Angelica had made](https://coolguy.website/flowers.html). We also smudged the room with Palo Santo, Mugwort, and Cedar, but this is of course up to you.

In essence, make the room as much of a cozy, dreamy, blanket pile of a room as you can.

When everyone is ready, sit around the circle to be cast (described next), and we start the gathering by describing and calling upon the elements within the circle.
