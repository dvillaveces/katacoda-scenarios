At this point, people started to play around in the terminal more, asking each other questions. I also showed `vimtutor` briefly as another option to start learning (though `vim` deserves its own ritual). When this energy of exploration was starting to soften, I asked people to ground to close out the circle and the night.

Everyone sat on the ground with their feet and hands firmly planted. Then, we imagined all the things we did and heard as a visible bright mist swirling in the room above our heads. And we imagined the mist entering into our heads, our necks, and shoulders and we pushed all this bright energy down through our bodies into our hands and feet and then out into the ground beneath us. It travelled through the concrete into the soil beneath the building. We sat in quiet and did this until it felt like all the strange energy we conjured up had left us and returned to the soil.

And then we ate and drank!
