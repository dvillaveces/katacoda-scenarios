This is the Solarpunk Magic Computer Club&rsquo;s *Enchantment Ritual* and now, a copy of it is also *your* enchantment ritual.

There is a deep [digital disquiet](https://tech-autonomy.com/the-digital-disquiet), a strong but amorphous feeling of unease resulting in ambient stress, specific anxieties, and material powerlessness rooted in the intuitive awareness of evil forces influencing our loves via our digital devices. We hope you use this ritual to ground yourself in an optimistic, solarpunk vision of a future free of the influences of white supremacist capitalist society that has poisoned the humanity of digital technologies as it has all other things it touches.

Using this ritual, you can regenerate your energy reserves, gaining [technomana](https://tech-autonomy.com/technomana) as you practice. Technomana is a force with which to recognize the opportunities for animatability of otherwise inanimate objects; the (super)power of techno(magic)-ability. Such powerful technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one&rsquo;s actual communities.

But like all powers, it must be practiced to be useful, not merely discussed or conceived.

It is our hope that this ritual will serve as the spring from which your technomana will be brought forth.
