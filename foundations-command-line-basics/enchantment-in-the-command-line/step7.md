We are in the far reaches of the computer, and could really damage things if we&rsquo;re not careful and so let&rsquo;s return home.

Type `cd ~`{{execute}} and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>. This brings you back to the home directory, no matter how far you&rsquo;ve travelled from it.

And now, let&rsquo;s add our own words to all of this.

Type `vim .vision.txt`{{execute}} and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>. *Vim* is a text editor that just lives in your computer, waiting for you to use it. You invoke it by speaking its name and the file you want to edit, in this case a secret file of your visions that no one on your computer can see unless they know the same right commands to invoke it.

It&rsquo;s a blank screen, of course. Type `i`{{execute}} to start writing (*inserting* text). And now, write again whatever vision that is in your head&mdash;write the place you see when you close your eyes.

When you are done, hit <kbd>escape</kbd>. Then type `:wq`{{execute}}.

We are back home, a home that includes your own personal, hidden place.
