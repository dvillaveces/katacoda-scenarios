Every computer has a CLI, whether you realize it or not.

**Do this** now to open the command line of your own computer, outside of this Web browser window:

* **On macOS,** you can access the CLI of your Mac by opening [the Terminal app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28macOS%29), which is probably in the *Applications &rarr; Utilities* folder. Consider spending a moment skimming the [Terminal User Guide for Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) published by Apple. Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand everything yet. Just skim it so you get a feel for what a macOS command line looks like.
* **On Windows,** you can access the CLI of your Windows computer by clicking in the Start icon, then searching for &ldquo;Command Prompt&rdquo; and clicking on the app that shows up (among [many other ways](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chdos.htm)). Consider spending a moment skimming [Computer Hope&rsquo;s article, How to use the Windows command line (DOS)](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm).
* **On Linux,** look for an application called &ldquo;XTerm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Terminal,&ldquo; &ldquo;gnome-terminal,&rdquo; &ldquo;konsole,&rdquo; or any of [a number of others](http://www.linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php). If you can&rsquo;t find one, don&rsquo;t worry; the command line environment in this practice lab is running on Linux.

Your computer&rsquo;s own command line interface might produce text that is slightly different than the text in our practice lab. That&rsquo;s perfectly normal. The important thing is that you can recognize the prompt (typically `$` on macOS and Linux or `>` on Windows).

Now that you know where the command line of your computer is, let&rsquo;s learn a little bit about how to use it.
