# Introduction

To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, this way of controlling a computer is called a *user interface* because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, &ldquo;to interface with&rdquo;) the computer system. In this module, you&rsquo;ll learn about a specific kind of user interface, called a *Command Line Interface* or *CLI* for short. Command line interfaces are different in some important ways from the point-and-click or *Graphical User Interface* (*GUI*) you may be more familiar with, but mastering the command line interface is without a doubt one of the most powerful ways of making computers do what you want.

Most [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/) practice labs and workshops either require the use of a command line, or provide additional detail available only via a command line interface, so we recommend that you become familiar with this way of controlling your computer before you do anything else.

# Overview

In this module, you'll learn:

* What a command line interface is.
* What a graphical interface is.
* The mataphors used by each interface and how they differ.
* Why the command line interface is still used today.

Let&rsquo;s begin by taking a look at an example command line interface and what you can do with it.
