Welcome to your (first?) command line environment! This Web page is divided into three panes and is intended to show the important differences between the different types of interfaces available to you when you use your computer.

1. The first pane contains this text that you&rsquo;re reading now.
1. The second pane at the top-right of the window shows you a toolbar with a folder icon, a circular arrow (&ldquo;refresh&rdquo;) button, and a tree-like diagram with a couple of files listed in it:  
    ![Screenshot of the Katacoda editor pane.](https://github.com/tech-learning-collective/katacoda-scenarios/raw/master/foundations-command-line-basics/commands-versus-buttons/assets/katacoda-editor-pane.png)  
    This second pane is an example of a *Graphical User Interface* or *GUI* for short; there are graphical icons and buttons you can press to change the display or take certain actions such as refreshing the pane&rsquo;s contents.
1. Finally, in the third pane, there is the *Command Line Interface* or *CLI* for short, which currently simply reads, &ldquo;Your Interactive Bash Terminal.&rdquo;  
    ![Screenshot of the Katacoda terminal pane.](https://github.com/tech-learning-collective/katacoda-scenarios/raw/master/foundations-command-line-basics/commands-versus-buttons/assets/katacoda-terminal-pane.png)

Notice that in the CLI, there are no buttons you can press. There are also no graphical icons. Instead, everything is presented to you as text that you must read.

Right now, there isn&rsquo; a lot of text. In fact, the only text displayed is a dollar sign (`$`). This is called a *prompt* and it is the conventional way that a CLI asks you what you&rsquo;d like to do next. Soon, you&rsquo;ll type some commands after the dollar sign to have the computer do some work for us but for the moment, just understand that this command line environment is a safe, isolated, practice lab environment created just for you; any work you do here will be deleted when you close your Web browser.

## Getting to your own computer&rsquo;s command line

Every computer has a CLI, whether you realize it or not.

**Do this** now to open the command line of your own computer, outside of this Web browser window:

* **If you are using a macOS computer,** you can access the CLI of your Mac by opening the Terminal app. Consider spending a moment skimming the [Terminal User Guide for Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) published by Apple. Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand everything yet, just skim it so you get a feel for what a macOS command line looks like.
* **If you are using a Windows computer,** you can access the CLI of your Windows computer by clicking in the Start icon, then searching for &ldquo;Command Prompt&rdquo; and clicking on the app that shows up (among [many other ways](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chdos.htm)). Consider spending a moment skimming [Computer Hope&rsquo;s article, How to use the Windows command line (DOS)](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm).
* **If you are using a Linux computer,** look for an application called &ldquo;XTerm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Terminal,&ldquo; or &ldquo;gnome-terminal,&rdquo; &ldquo;konsole,&rdquo; or any of [a number of others](http://www.linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php). If you can&rsquo;t find one, don&rsquo;t worry; the command line environment in this practice lab is running on Linux.
