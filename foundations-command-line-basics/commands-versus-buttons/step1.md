Welcome to your (first?) command line environment! This Web page is divided into three panes and is intended to show the important differences between the different types of interfaces available to you when you use your computer.

1. The first pane contains this text that you&rsquo;re reading now. If you are using a mobile device or simply have a very narrow browser window, this is the only pane that will be visible, but **you can switch to the other panes by swiping left on the header of this page**.
1. The second pane at the top-right of the window shows you a toolbar with a folder icon, a circular arrow (&ldquo;refresh&rdquo;) button, and a tree-like diagram with a couple of files listed in it:

    This second pane is an example of a [*Graphical User Interface* or *GUI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) for short; there are graphical icons and buttons you can press to change the display or take certain actions such as refreshing the pane&rsquo;s contents.
1. Finally, in the third pane, there is the [*Command Line Interface* or *CLI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for short, which currently simply reads, &ldquo;Your Interactive Bash Terminal.&rdquo;

Notice that in the CLI, there are no buttons you can press. There are also no graphical icons. Instead, everything is presented to you as text that you must read.

Right now, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of text. In fact, the only text displayed is a dollar sign (`$`). This is called a *prompt* and it is the conventional way that a CLI on macOS and Linux computers ask you what you&rsquo;d like to do next. On Windows computers, the conventional prompt is the greater-than sign (`>`), but it means the same thing.

Soon, you&rsquo;ll type some commands after the dollar sign to have the computer do some work for us. For the moment, though, just understand that this command line environment is a safe, isolated, practice lab environment created just for you. Any work you do here will be deleted when you refresh your Web browser window. To do real work with a command line, you need to access your own computer&rsquo;s command line interface, so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do next.
