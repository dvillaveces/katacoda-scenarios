Finally, let&rsquo;s have a quick look at another command available to you on the command line to get help quickly, the `apropos` command. It is used for asking a system, &ldquo;What are the appropriate commands for&hellip;?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is apropos of&hellip;?&rdquo; This command takes one required argument, a keyword to search for. Like other commands, you can look up more information about how to use the `apropos` command by reading its synopsis and description in its man page:

```sh
man apropos
```{{execute}}

As before, press the <kbd>q</kbd> key on your keyboard to quit the pager opened by the `man` command and return to your prompt.

The `apropos` command is particularly useful in finding out what other commands are installed and available on a computer system.

For example, to search for commands appropriate for interacting with the Web, you might try `apropos web`. Similarly, you could search for commands related to manipulating files by using `apropos file` and seeing what comes back. Since different computer systems have different programs installed on them, the results won&rsquo;t always be the same on every computer you use. However, if you do this enough times, you&rsquo;ll start to expect a certain set of standard utilities to be available on every modern computer because they are so popular.

Much like learning any language, you&rsquo;ll find that the majority of your time when you start out is spent simply picking up new vocabulary. Let this take as long as you need it to. Practice regularly by returning here or opening the CLI on your own computer. Either way, never hesitate to look up more information about a command by using the `man` command or just doing an Internet search in your favorite Web browser.
