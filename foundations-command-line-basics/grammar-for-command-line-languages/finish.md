In this module, you learned the basics of the Bash command line grammar. You learned how to construct simple command &rsquo;sentences&rdquo; that consisted of an executable word optionally followed by one or more arguments. You saw that the valid arguments to a given command are defined by the executable you&rsquo;re using, and practiced how to recognize short and long options.

You also learned about how to use the built-in help options such as the `help`, `man`, and `apropos` commands to find and understand how to use other commands that you don&rsquo;t already know about. This knowledge is the most foundational mechanic that you must become familiar with to use a CLI effectively. Give yourself time to pick up more command line vocabulary as you go through the rest of this course.
