Now that you understand that command line interfaces (CLIs) use a linguistic metaphor to make it possible for you to &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to your digital assistant (your computer), the next thing you need to learn is the basic grammar or structure of the command line &ldquo;language&rdquo; itself.

All languages have a set of rules that define how meaning is derived from the language&rsquo;s written texts or audible sounds. For example, the words you&rsquo;re reading right now only have meaning to you because you understand how to look at the shapes that make up the letters in each word (called *glyphs*), recognize the individual letters (called *characters*), and know that when a certain sequence of specific letters run together, they combine to form *words* that have a pre-defined meaning to you based on your knowledge of the English language. Computer languages, including the language of the command line interface, follow this same exact principle to make text meaningful to both computers and people.

In this module, you&rsquo;ll learn the basic grammatical and syntactic rules of the command line language so that you can begin to write (or &ldquo;speak&rdquo;) commands to your computer, and better understand the replies written to your screen by your computer.
